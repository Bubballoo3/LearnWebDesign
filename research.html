        Research Experience

        In the summer of 2023 I was fortunate enough to be accepted into the 
        <a href="https://u.osu.edu/ohio5sure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Ohio Five Summer Undergraduate Research Experience
        </a>
        program at The Ohio State University.
        While there, I worked with Professor 
        <a href="https://people.math.osu.edu/cueto.5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Maria Angelica Cueto, PhD
        </a>
        on some of her research involving the Tropical Semiring.

        The <span class="bold" >tropical semiring</span> is a mathematical space where the operations of 
        addition and multiplication are redefined. Tropical addition is defined as 
        the maximum or minimum over the two elements being summed,
        while tropical multiplication is simply classical addition.

        When this begins to be applied to polynomials, specifically lines, conics, and cubics,
        the result is the tree-looking object projected down in the image above.

        During the course of this REU I coded my very first software, a set 
        of three programs for the calculation and display of tropical curves.
        While the computational technology to calculate them has existed, this was 
        one of the very first GUI's designed to be used without extensive computational 
        expertise. The programs run on SageMath, a mathematical engine for Python.
